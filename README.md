# E-Buddy
E-Buddy for rescued child labour:
This project aims to address the issue of child labour by providing a platform for reporting and registering complaints involving children under the age of 14 performing labor, which can be considered malpractice under the Child Labour Act of 1986.
This project provides a user-friendly website where anyone who witnesses any form of child labor can easily report or register a complaint. The reported information will be verified to determine if the occupation fits as illegal practice according to the Child Labour Act. Once verified, the information will be directed to concerned authorities, which may include the police and NGOs. These authorities can take appropriate actions to rescue the children from exploitative situations and provide them with necessary facilities such as food, shelter, and education.
Features/Process:
Users can register complaints online by providing details of child labor incidents they witness.
Reported complaints will undergo a verification process to ensure accuracy and validity.
Verified complaints will be directly forwarded to concerned authorities for further action.
NGOs and organizations working for child welfare can access reported complaints to provide necessary assistance and support to the victims.
